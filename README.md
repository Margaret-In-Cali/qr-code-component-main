## My process

When building out a responsive layout, I usually like to build the desktop design first and work "backward" to accommodate smaller screen sizes. For this challenge, I did the opposite: I built the mobile deisng and then worked my way up to the desktop. For a layout that contains only one element (the QR "card"), this was simple. But I would like to work on coding mobile responsive layouts from smallest to largest on future projects that have many more elements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I don't use CSS variables very often, but I practiced using them here in this project. I had forgotten how simple they made coding CSS, and I definitely want to rely on them more in future projects.

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
    --attr-color: hsl(228, 45%, 44%);
    --main-font: 15px;
  }
```

### Continued development

I feel pretty comfortable coding responsive layouts, but I could definitely improve. That's what I'm going to focus on in the immediate future.
